## 3.1.0

This release includes accessibility improvements, pre-commit hooks, and various enhancements.

- Accessibility improvements:
  - Underline links inside main content, to make them recognizable without color.
  - Improve contrast of link colors
  - Add ARIA names to sidebar social icons.
- Add pre-commit hooks for code quality:
  - djlint for Jinja2 templates
  - Trailing whitespace
  - JSON/YAML checker
  - Assets build
- Move `static/`, `templates/`, and `translations/` directories back to root to make it easier to use the theme from source code (e.g. a `git clone`). Reflex remains installable via PyPI with the same interface.
- Upgrade Isso to 0.13.0.
- Highlight Isso comments made by the page author.
- Refactor footer templates.
- Remove Flex-inherited Google Analytics config.
- Mark AddThis as defunct in README (will be removed in Reflex 4.0.0).

## 3.0.3

- Fix links to Github on the PyPI project page.

## 3.0.2

This is a bugfix release.

- Fix wrong references to the project, from *python-theme-reflex* to *pelican-theme-reflex*. While this didn't affect the functionality of Reflex, it affected the installation instructions and most links.
